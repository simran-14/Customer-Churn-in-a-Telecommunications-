# Customer-Churn-in-a-Telecommunications-
This project predicts customer churn for a telecommunications company, helping to identify at-risk customers for proactive retention. We performed exploratory data analysis, handled missing values, applied one-hot encoding, and standardized numerical features. Key algorithms tested included Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, with Gradient Boosting showing the best performance after hyperparameter tuning. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC confirmed the modelâ€™s effectiveness. Key factors influencing churn were identified, including tenure and monthly charges. Future work includes refining features and implementing real-time predictions to improve customer retention strategies.
